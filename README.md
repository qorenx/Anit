CodeIgniter 4.1.9 is used. We will try to keep it up to date.

I hope I can bring it to a simple site level. I've opened things like GitHub discussion or issue asking for help. They can help. But let me point this out. I am a student, I am making a website for the first time. I'm not an expert. I move forward by learning and making mistakes.

The current situation; localhost is installed.

Completion Status; It hasn't started yet.

I plan to rewrite it as Back and Front. I'll take care of it until the exams are over. I'll try to make it a little simpler.

I wanted to learn to code. I set myself a goal. I hope I can make a site with the features I want. I will be using the latest version of CodeIgniter 4 while doing this. Because it's simple and fast. Ideal for starting learning.
Anyone who wants to help with the coding can open a merge request or discussion. I add team.

Completion Status; %1 -Stop
