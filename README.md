I wanted to learn to code. I set myself a goal. I hope I can make a site with the features I want. I will be using the latest version of CodeIgniter 4 while doing this. Because it's simple and fast. Ideal for starting learning.
Anyone who wants to help with the coding can open a merge request or discussion. I add team.
